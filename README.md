# Background

Based on different global surveys such as [Deloitte’s 2020 Global Blockchain Survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/understanding-blockchain-potential/global-blockchain-survey.html) or [PwC’s Global Blockchain Survey](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/blockchain/blockchain-in-business.html) about blockchain we can state there is still lack of trust against blockchains due to various reasons. Key arguments relate to implementation, regulation, compliance and the lack of trust in general. However blockchain technology itself promises and realizes a high level of transparency, understanding and experiencing this attribute of that technology is not that obvious, since the use of the existing high quality blockchain tools mostly requires some level of knowledge about the blockchain technology itself. Giving a simple example, comparing the view of a bank account history to the view of the history of a blockchain wallet, seems like we would order extra parts to our new vehicles directly with product numbers instead of their names.

The output of blockchain explorers are obvious for experts but hardly understandable for outsiders and mostly out of scope for authorities or financial institutions. Our product turns blockchain explorer output into classical documents like Statement of Account or Account Activity.
